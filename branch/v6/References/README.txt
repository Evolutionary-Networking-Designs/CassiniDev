this project is an experiement in using nuget/symbolsource to pull source files for dependent packages for direct inclusion into consuming projects

e.g.  adding and keeping current source for Salient.ReflectiveLoggingAdapter to the Salient.CassiniDev project.


currently struggling to resolve a nuget squatting issue http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/370828
